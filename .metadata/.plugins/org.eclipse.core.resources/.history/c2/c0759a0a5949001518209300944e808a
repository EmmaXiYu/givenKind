			<h1>About Us</h1>
			
			<p>giveNkind is a Chicago-based nonprofit organization dedicated to re-imagining giving to maximize the impact of a 
			charitable gift for both donors and nonprofits.  Founded by Emily Petway and a volunteer board of directors in 2012, 
			giveNkind exists to support small to medium sized charities that lack the infrastructure to develop an in-kind donation 
			exchange platform of their own, and donors looking for the opportunity to make a personal connection through the purposeful 
			donation of their gently used goods.  Through our simple and flexible online service, we offer a quintessential matching 
			system that helps create mutually beneficial connections directly between donors and nonprofits.</p>
			
			<h2>Our Vision</h2>
			<p>The vision of the giveNkind organization is to support nonprofits in bettering the world.<br></p>
			
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>At giveNkind, our mission is to make giving more personal and purposeful.  We do this by providing a searchable, online 
			database that creates opportunities for individuals with items to donate to find, and directly connect with, registered 
			nonprofits that can re-purpose those items for good within their community.
			giveNkind is a registered 501(c)(3) organization.  View our IRS determination letter here.  For a quick overview of 
			giveNkind, our mission and board member contact information, download our giveNkind Summary information page.  
			Please contact us at info@givenkind.org or (847) 802-8799 for more information.</p>

			<h2>The giveNkind Story</h2>
			<p>After founding the Atlanta chapter of Becca’s Closet in 2009, giveNkind founder Emily Petway quickly discovered that, in order 
			to fulfill the organization’s mission of providing prom dresses to high school girls without the means to buy them, she would need 
			much more than dresses.  Her “wish list” included things like clothing racks, shoe racks, mirrors, chairs and curtains – many of 
			which she did not have the budget to afford.  Petway turned to the media to spread the word about the items she needed to support 
			her local community.  When people contacted her to donate, many said they had been searching for a long time to find a good cause 
			to donate their items to, and thus, her dream of creating an easier way to help nonprofits extend their community reach was born.
			In 2012, Petway moved to Gurnee, Illinois and founded giveNkind, a nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting individuals and 
			businesses with items to give with the nonprofits that needed them using a free, online platform.  By 2014 the organization had 
			grown to include nine volunteer and advisory board members.  In February of that year, the IRS accepted giveNkind as a 501(c)(3) 
			nonprofit organization and her dream came step closer to reality.  
			Over the next 2 and a half years, the giveNkind team worked with several partners to bring Petway’s vision to life.  In June of 
			2015, the website officially launched.  There are several organizations across the country that help facilitate in-kind donations 
			between donors and recipients, but giveNkind is the first to offer these services specifically for 501(c)(3) registered organizations, 
			using a free online platform on a nationwide scale.  By providing a searchable database of items available for donation and nonprofit 
			wish lists and facilitating direct communication between donors with items to give and nonprofits in need, giveNkind makes the donation 
			process more purposeful and personal.</p>
